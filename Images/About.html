<p>Hi there! My name is Megan. I love art and have recently begun creating websites in HTML and CSS. I find inspiration for my artwork in nature and in everyday life. Sometimes the ordinary is extraordinary. Currently I am a student of the GIS Application Specialist program at Fleming College. I have created a blog as a part of this website to keep reflect on each day moving forward in the program. i find online learning quite difficult, thus, this blog can help me reflect and overcome my difficulties. Thank you for kindly visiting my website! I really hoped you enjoyed your time here and come again soon!</p>
