<h1>Welcome to Megan's Virtual Art Gallery</h1> 
<!-- declares this paragraph 1. Referred to in Css sheet. Id in this case is unique-->
<p id="para1"> This art gallery displays five pieces which I think represent myself and the way I relate with the world around me 
Please take your time to explore my gallery and learn about the creative process and inspiration behind each piece.</p> 
<p> Please note, this is the first website I have ever coded a website. Though I found it difficult, I have noticed there are many similarities 
between using html to build a website and creating a piece of art. I will touch on this briefly in each of the captions of my work below.</p>

			<figcaption> <cite> Eyeing the Universe. Pencil. 2015 </cite><p>This piece was inspired by the Andromeda Galaxy. After a visit to the Harry Bayley Observatory in Barbados with my Grand parents, I decided to create this drawing.  I never knew much about space before the visit. However, the visit opened my eyes and sparked my curiosity for what lay beyond Earth’s atmosphere. 
I feel the same way about my programming courses. It often feels as though there is an entire universe to learn about regarding the syntax and semantics of each language.

			<figcaption> 
			<cite> Double Hibiscus. Pen. 2014. </cite>
			<p> I enjoyed completing this study of the Hibiscus Flower. The many intricate folds of the beautiful petals made it challenging to represent on paper. I often lost my position of the exact petal I was currently drawing as I looked down at my work and back at the flower multiple times. It often took a few minutes to find the same petal again. 
I find I am the same when writing HTML or CSS. For example, when creating this webpage, I wished to display my work horizontally instead of vertically. This was to create the feeling as though one could be walking by the art in an actual gallery. Finding and using the right HTML syntax was a challenge, just like drawing the flower. My mind wondered from idea to idea on what the framework of the webpage should be like as though I were searching for the petals of the flower to draw. However, it was rewarding to see both come to life and completed in the end.</p>

			<img src="Lion.jpg" alt="Drawing of a Lion">
			
			<figcaption> <cite> Lion. Pencil. 2015. </cite><p> This piece took 2 days to draw with a mechanical pencil. It was drawn to emphasize the lion’s mane and fur. Honestly, sometimes it is quite easy to become too involved in the task at hand. This certainly happened when I drew this piece. Furthermore, this happened when selecting the CSS to style this page. This experience taught me it takes time and experience to design a webpage that fits your idea but is also functional. </figcaption>

			<img src="Mountain.jpg" alt="Drawing of a Mountain">  
			
			<figcaption> <cite> Mountain behind Grenfell Campus. Pen. 2015.  </cite><p> This drawing was done in my first year of university of a journal I kept. I often keep journals to record, remember and reflect on experiences I have had. I find creating comments in HTML is like this. They help me to understand the code I used and allow me to keep track of improvements I have made. </p></figcaption>

			<img src="Music.jpg" alt="Drawing of a woman">  
			
			<figcaption> <cite> Music. Pen and pencil. 2016. </cite><p> This image was inspired by my love for the violin. I used a variety of shading techniques on top of the original pen drawing to acieve the particular tone. The combination of techniques I used remind me of the way CSS and HTML are combined to create a final webpage. The pen provides the structure (HTML) whilst the pencil shading adds the style(CSS).</p></figcaption>
